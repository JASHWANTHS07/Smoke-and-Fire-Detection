# Smoke-and-Fire-Detection
This project is a deep learning-based language translation system. It includes a complete pipeline for training a model, performing inference, and running an interactive interface for real-time translation. The model is trained using PyTorch and supports multiple languages.

## 📌 Overview

This project is designed to [briefly explain the purpose of the project]. It includes:
- **Model Training**: A Jupyter Notebook (`Training.ipynb`) for training the model.
- **Inference**: A Jupyter Notebook (`Inference.ipynb`) for making predictions.
- **Main Script**: `main.py` to load the trained model and run the interface.

## ⚙️ Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later).

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Training the Model
To train the model, open `Training.ipynb` and run all the cells.

### 2️⃣ Running Inference
Use `Inference.ipynb` to make predictions using the trained model.

### 3️⃣ Running the Interface
Run the main script to start the interface:
```bash
python main.py
```
This loads the trained model and launches an interactive UI.

## 🛠 Configuration
Modify `main.py` to update the model path if needed:
```python
model_path = 'D:\\Users\\DELL\\Desktop\\.2\\trained-models\\model_final.pth'
```
